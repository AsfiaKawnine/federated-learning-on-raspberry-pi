# Federated Learning with Raspberry PI (PySyft)
Scholars from the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge from Facebook and Udacity working together to implement the tutorial from OpenMined: https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/

We will set up PySyft on two Raspberry Pis and learn how to train a Recurrent Neural Network on a Raspberry Pi via PySyft.
