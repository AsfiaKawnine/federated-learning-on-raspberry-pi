Project based on https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/

In the project was done:
- Installation the environment on the windows computer and Raspberry Pi 4 B+  (PySyft, PyTorch, Python, etc.)
- Established remotely connection.
- Started the worker 'Alice' and trained the model.  

p.s.: at the step 21 meets the problem, the reason should be find...still working on it.
